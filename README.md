# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

I think this project could be improved with a better color scheme or more features on the website, like maybe an events page or photos that show off the vibe of the coffee shop as well as some of the drinks and food you can get there.
